- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @PaulLessard! Iâ€™m an interdisciplinary mathematician with  a background in pure mathematics, in particular:
  
  - higher category theory,
  - type theory, and
  - homotopy theory.
 
  Since 2023 I've been working in machine learning, for example the position paper: [Categorical Deep Learning](https://categoricaldeeplearning.com/).
